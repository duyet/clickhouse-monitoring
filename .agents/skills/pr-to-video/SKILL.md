description: "turn a GitHub pull request (a PR URL like github.com/<owner>/<repo>/pull/<N>, an <owner>/<repo>#<N> ref, or 'this PR' in a checked-out repo) into a code-change explainer video, up to ~3 min (sweet spot 30-90s) — changelog, feature reveal, fix, or refactor walkthrough, rendered from the diff / commits / files. The input is a CODE CHANGE read via the gh CLI; there is no website capture. Use this skill for a GitHub PR. Do not use it for a product launch/promo (use /product-launch-video), a tour of a real website (use /website-to-video), a topic explainer with no PR (use /faceless-explainer), captions on existing footage (use /embedded-captions), or a short unnarrated motion graphic (use /motion-graphics). If the intent is unclear, route through /hyperframes first."

# PR to HyperFrames

Use this skill to ingest a GitHub pull request, understand the change, plan a code-change explainer, and build it frame by frame in HyperFrames. The input is a **code change** (read via `gh`), not a website — there is **no capture step and no real assets** beyond the contributors' avatars.

> **Confirm the route before Step 0.** You are the orchestrator. Run each step, verify its gate, and only then continue. This skill is for a **GitHub pull request** (a code change). Route other intents elsewhere: a product launch/promo → `/product-launch-video`; a general website tour → `/website-to-video`; a topic explainer with no PR → `/faceless-explainer`; captions on existing footage → `/embedded-captions`; a short unnarrated motion graphic → `/motion-graphics`; a whole-repo or multi-PR release walkthrough → `/general-video`. **Out of scope:** live / at-render-time data — PR facts are read once at author time and baked in. If the user says only "make a video" or the route is uncertain, read `/hyperframes` first.

You are the orchestrator. Work in `videos/<project>/`. Run steps in order and pass each gate before continuing. User-gated steps are Step 0, Step 3, and Step 6. Do every step yourself except Step 5, where you dispatch one sub-agent per frame. Do not put design or motion rules here; those live in the frame-worker sub-agent, `hyperframes-creative`, and `hyperframes-animation`.

Workflow: Step 0 setup → `hyperframes.json`; Step 1 ingest → `capture/extracted/` + `assets/<login>.png`; Step 2 design system → `frame.md`; Step 3 storyboard/script → `STORYBOARD.md` and `SCRIPT.md`; Step 3.1 audio → `audio_meta.json`; Step 4 visual design → enriched `STORYBOARD.md`; Step 5 frames → `compositions/frames/NN-*.html` and `index.html`; Step 6 final render → `renders/video.mp4`.

---

## Step 0: Setup and Brief

Goal: Lock the PR reference and the core video brief, and create the HyperFrames project if needed.

Get the **PR reference** (a full URL, an `<owner>/<repo>#<N>` ref, or "this PR" in a checked-out repo) and, in one message, confirm the brief — lead with a recommended default for each and pre-fill anything `/hyperframes` already set: **angle** (changelog / feature-reveal / fix-explainer / refactor-walkthrough — default: infer from the PR), **audience** (default: developers), **length** (default: **scale to the PR's change size** — see below), **aspect** (default 16:9), **language**. The style is always **claude**. Proceed only after the user replies; a "go" accepts the defaults.

**Recommend the length from the PR's change size**, not a fixed guess. Before confirming the brief, peek at the PR once — a read-only call that also grounds the angle (Step 1 still does the full deterministic fetch):

```bash
gh pr view <PR_REF> --json title,additions,deletions,changedFiles
```

Pick the tier from `additions + deletions` (nudged up by `changedFiles`) and lead with it as the default (the user can override; hard cap ~3 min):

| PR change size                    | Recommended length |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| trivial (≲ 50 lines changed)      | ~20–40s            |
| focused (~50–200 lines)           | ~40–70s            |
| substantial (~200–600 lines)      | ~70–110s           |
| large (≳ 600 lines, or 25+ files) | ~110–180s          |

State the basis in one phrase when you propose it (e.g. "~40s — small change, +44/−13 across 12 files"). A huge PR doesn't mean a long video — if the story is one headline change, keep it tight and say so.

Initialize only if `hyperframes.json` is missing. Name `<project>` from the PR in kebab-case, such as `acme-sdk-pr-1842`; never use the workspace name or a timestamp.

`npx hyperframes init "videos/<project>" --non-interactive --skip-skills --example=blank`

**Show sign-in status before the brief** — run `npx hyperframes auth status` and **relay its output verbatim (don't paraphrase or rewrite it).** It reports whether voice/BGM will use HeyGen or local engines and, when not signed in, how to sign in. **If not signed in, STOP and wait for the user to choose — sign in, or say "go"/"offline" to continue with local engines — before asking the brief or anything else.** Treat it as a real decision point, not a passing note; don't fold the choice into the brief question, and don't write keys into a per-repo `.env`. (In autonomous mode, note the status and continue offline.) See `../hyperframes-media` → Preflight for the canonical guidance.

**Gate:** `hyperframes.json` exists; the PR ref is captured; angle, length, aspect ratio, and language are locked; sign-in status was shown (signed in, or continuing offline).

---

## Step 1: Ingest the PR (no capture)

Goal: Fetch the PR's facts and fold them into the project as the source of information. There is **no website capture**. `fetch-pr.mjs` runs `gh` deterministically — completing the files list via paginated `gh api` so a large PR doesn't truncate at ~100 files, and writing only `capture/pr.json` + `capture/diff.patch` (no scratch dir). Then `ingest.mjs` folds that into the synthetic capture package offline.

```bash
PR="<url | owner/repo#N | N>"

# Fetch the PR deterministically: runs gh, completes the files list via paginated
# gh api (so a big PR doesn't truncate at ~100 files), writes only capture/pr.json +
# capture/diff.patch — no scratch dir. gh auth / not-found / private errors exit 1 here.
(cd "videos/<project>" && node <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/fetch-pr.mjs --pr "$PR" --out-dir ./capture)

# Offline transform → capture/extracted/{tokens.json (colors:[] → claude palette),
# visible-text.txt (the brief), people.json (contributors, bot-filtered, avatarFile=assets/<login>.png)}.
(cd "videos/<project>" && node <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/ingest.mjs \
  --pr-json ./capture/pr.json --diff ./capture/diff.patch --out-dir ./capture/extracted)

# The people front's one network step — download each contributor's GitHub avatar to
# assets/<login>.png for an optional credits close. Best-effort; always exits 0.
(cd "videos/<project>" && node <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/fetch-people-avatars.mjs \
  --people ./capture/extracted/people.json)
```

If `fetch-pr.mjs` exits 1 (gh auth / not found / private), report its stderr and stop — **do not fabricate PR contents**. If `ingest.mjs` exits 1, read its stderr (usually a malformed `pr.json`), fix, and rerun (deterministic). `fetch-people-avatars.mjs` always exits 0; missing avatars just mean no credits close to author.

**Gate:** `capture/pr.json`, `capture/diff.patch`, `capture/extracted/tokens.json`, `capture/extracted/visible-text.txt`, and `capture/extracted/people.json` exist; you can state the PR's change in one clear sentence. `assets/<login>.png` is best-effort — its absence is not a failure.

---

## Step 2: Design System

Goal: Adopt the claude frame preset; a script turns it into this video's `frame.md` + caption skin.

The style is fixed — **claude** (warm editorial; a navy code surface built for diffs). Run:

```bash
node <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/build-frame.mjs --preset claude --hyperframes .
```

The script copies the claude preset's `FRAME.md` → `frame.md`, remixes it onto any brand tokens in `capture/extracted/tokens.json` (a PR has none → `colors:[]`/`fonts:[]` keeps claude's own palette, a complete design), copies the preset's caption skin to `.hyperframes/caption-skin.html`, and self-validates (exits 1 on a broken mapping). Proceed as soon as it exits 0 — no hand-editing.

**Gate:** `build-frame.mjs` exited 0 — `frame.md` exists from the claude preset, and `.hyperframes/caption-skin.html` exists as the caption skin source.

---

## Step 3: Storyboard and Script

Goal: Turn the PR into an approved frame-by-frame explanation plan.

Read `references/story-design.md`, `../hyperframes-core/references/storyboard-format.md`, and `../hyperframes-core/references/script-format.md`. Use them to write `STORYBOARD.md` and, when narration is needed, `SCRIPT.md`.

Use `story-design.md` for the PR archetype (changelog / feature-reveal / fix-explainer / refactor-walkthrough), the PR-native frame types, hook, persuasion, beats, the per-frame word budget, and the optional credits close. The sequence comes from **narrative design, not the diff's file order** — explain the change, don't read the diff aloud. Feature 2–4 real diff hunks (from `capture/diff.patch`), each a small legible snippet; name the `code-*` block each wants in the frame's `scene`. Frames carry no `asset_candidates` except an optional `credits` close (2–6 `assets/<login>.png` avatars). Use the exact required fields from the storyboard and script references.

After drafting, show a frame-by-frame summary. In that same message ask the user (a) to approve or request changes, and (b) whether they want a live preview of the storyboard scaffold (`npx hyperframes preview`) — open it only on a yes. Iterate until approved; carry the preview choice to Step 6.

**Gate:** `STORYBOARD.md` exists, every frame has the required narrative fields, `SCRIPT.md` exists when narration is needed, and the user approved the plan.

---

## Step 3.1: Audio

Goal: Generate narration, word timings, music, and audio metadata from the approved script.

Start audio after Step 3 approval. Run it in the background, then continue to Step 4.

`node <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/audio.mjs --script ./SCRIPT.md --storyboard ./STORYBOARD.md --hyperframes . --out ./audio_meta.json &`

The audio script handles narration, word timings, BGM lookup from HeyGen's music library, and timing metadata. BGM mood comes from the storyboard's `music:` field. This uses the HeyGen Audio API for retrieval, not generation, and the same `~/.heygen` credential as TTS. For provider details, read `../hyperframes-media/references/tts.md`.

If there is no narration and no `SCRIPT.md`, skip voice generation. BGM may still run if the storyboard has a music mood.

**Gate:** audio job has started, or the project is marked silent.

---

## Step 4: Frame Visual Design

Goal: Add the visual direction, layout intent, and motion choices to each storyboard frame.

Edit `STORYBOARD.md` in place. Do not create another storyboard. Use `frame.md` as the source of truth for color, type, layout feel, and style.

Read `references/visual-design.md`, `references/composition.md`, `references/motion-language.md`, `references/code-vocabulary.md`, and `../hyperframes-animation/`. Use `visual-design.md` for required frame fields and the required `## Video direction` block, and for how a code beat names a `code-*` block as its `focal`. Use `code-vocabulary.md` to pick the right block per beat (diff = `code-diff`, refactor = `code-morph`, new code = `code-typing`, …). Use `composition.md` for layout/hierarchy/focal points and `motion-language.md` + `../hyperframes-animation/` for valid effect and blueprint IDs. Do not invent effect names or block/blueprint IDs.

For every frame, add required visual and motion fields, including `effects` and `focal` and/or `roles`. For a code beat, name the `code-*` block as the `focal` and let `effects` choreograph the surrounding claude Code Surface (not the code animation, which the block owns). Add one video-wide `## Video direction` block.

Do not change story, script, `transition_in`, `asset_candidates`, or the PR source. Do not write HTML in this step. There is **no asset-staging step** — the only real assets are the credits avatars, already in `assets/`.

**Gate:** every frame has `effects` plus `focal` and/or `roles`; code frames name a `code-*` block; `## Video direction` exists.

---

## Step 5: Build Frames

Goal: Build every storyboard frame as an HTML composition and assemble the playable video.

Wait for Step 3.1 audio to finish if audio was started. Then sync durations and fetch SFX; skip both if silent.

`node <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/audio.mjs sync-durations --audio-meta ./audio_meta.json --storyboard ./STORYBOARD.md`

`node <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/audio.mjs fetch-sfx --storyboard ./STORYBOARD.md --hyperframes .`

Duration sync is mechanical: real voice duration wins; silent frames keep estimates; never hand-edit synced durations.

**Pre-install the registry blocks** named across `STORYBOARD.md` once, before dispatch, so parallel workers don't race on the registry:

`for b in <each registry block named in the storyboard>; do npx hyperframes add "$b"; done`

Before dispatch, read `sub-agents/frame-worker.md` and `../hyperframes-core/references/subagent-dispatch.md`. Dispatch one sub-agent per frame, in parallel if possible; otherwise run workers in waves. Each worker gets exactly one frame. Each worker's context must include `PROJECT_DIR`, `frame_id`, canvas size, caption status and keep-out band if captions are enabled, `ANIM_DIR` (absolute path to `../hyperframes-animation/`), and the absolute path to `references/code-vocabulary.md`. Each worker reads `frame.md`, its own `## Frame N` block, the recipe body for each cited effect/blueprint ID, and — for a code beat — `code-vocabulary.md` for the named block's inputs. Each worker writes only `compositions/frames/NN-*.html`; workers never edit `STORYBOARD.md`.

As each worker returns, mark that frame `animated` in `STORYBOARD.md`.

After audio timings exist, build captions in the background and assemble the index:

`node <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/captions.mjs build --storyboard ./STORYBOARD.md --audio-meta ./audio_meta.json --hyperframes . --out ./caption_groups.json &`

`node <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/assemble-index.mjs --storyboard ./STORYBOARD.md --hyperframes .`

`captions.mjs` uses the project's `.hyperframes/caption-skin.html` (claude's, copied in Step 2), injecting brand tokens from `frame.md`; `captions: skipped (<reason>)` is valid. `assemble-index.mjs` stages the credits avatars from `assets/` as an idempotent backstop.

**Gate:** every frame is marked `animated`, `index.html` exists, and captions are built or explicitly skipped.

---

## Step 6: Finalize

Goal: Verify the assembled video, get user approval, and render the final MP4.

Inject transitions, run checks, pause for review, then render.

`node <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/transitions.mjs inject --storyboard ./STORYBOARD.md --hyperframes .`

`node <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/transitions.mjs verify --storyboard ./STORYBOARD.md --index ./index.html`

`npx hyperframes lint`

`npx hyperframes validate`

`npx hyperframes inspect`

`npx hyperframes snapshot --at <frame-midpoints>`

`snapshot` stitches the captured frames into one contact sheet (`snapshots/contact-sheet.jpg`). Glance at it; if nothing is obviously broken, move on — don't linger here.

If a command fails, surface stderr and stop — don't pile on recovery commands. Fix it yourself: the cheapest safe edit to `compositions/frames/NN-*.html`, then rerun the failed check.

**Known false-positive — do not chase it.** `inspect` may report a handful of `text_box_overflow` errors of ~1–4px on the **caption** highlight words (selector `#caption-word-*` / `.caption-line`). The caption pill uses a deliberately snug `line-height` (set once in `scripts/captions.mjs`) and has **no `overflow:hidden`**, so a heavy display glyph's ink spills a few px into the pill's own padding — nothing is actually clipped. Treat these as expected and proceed. Do **not** inflate the caption `line-height` (it balloons the pill, which is worse). Only act on a `text_box_overflow` when it names a **frame** element (`#el-NN-*`), not a caption word.

After checks pass, pause for user review. The video is assembled, viewable, and editable in Studio. Manage preview only once across Step 3 and Step 6: open it if the user asked earlier, offer it if they declined earlier, do not ask again if they are already reviewing in Studio.

Preview: `npx hyperframes preview`

Render only after user approval:

`npx hyperframes render --skill=pr-to-video --quality high --output renders/video.mp4`

Do not rerun `lint`, `validate`, `inspect`, or `snapshot` after rendering unless the user asks.

**Gate:** `lint`, `validate`, and `inspect` passed before render; user approved at the review pause; `renders/video.mp4` exists. Final reply states the MP4 path and final duration.

---

## Quick Reference

**Formats:** landscape `1920x1080` by default; portrait `1080x1920`; square `1080x1080`. Set the format once in the storyboard frontmatter.

**PR deltas vs a captured-asset workflow:** no Step 1 capture (the `gh` CLI ingests the PR into a synthetic `capture/extracted/` package — `tokens.json` + `visible-text.txt` + `people.json`); the only real assets are the contributors' `assets/<login>.png` avatars (an optional credits close); no `asset-descriptions.md`, no asset-staging step. Code beats are rendered by the `code-*` registry blocks on claude's navy Code Surface; the style is always **claude**.

**Background scripts:** the workflow ships these under `scripts/`: `fetch-pr` (PR → `capture/pr.json` + `diff.patch` via `gh`; large-PR-safe, no scratch), `ingest` (→ synthetic capture package; offline), and `fetch-people-avatars` (contributor avatars → `assets/`); plus the shared engine — `build-frame` (adopt + brand-remix a preset into `frame.md` + caption skin), `audio` (TTS, BGM, SFX, duration sync), `captions`, `transitions` (inject + verify), and `assemble-index`. Everything else is the `hyperframes` CLI. Code blocks install via `npx hyperframes add <name>`.
