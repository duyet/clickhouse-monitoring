  The fallback workflow for authoring custom HyperFrames video compositions at
  any length or format — longer or multi-scene pieces, brand / sizzle reels,
  montages, title cards, static loops, and freeform compositions. Input- and
  length-agnostic. If a specialized workflow clearly fits the input — a
  marketed product, a website, a topic explainer, a GitHub PR, existing
  footage, a short motion graphic, or a Remotion port — prefer it (see
  /hyperframes); use this only as the general fallback when none fit.

# general-video — general video workflow

> **Confirm the route before you build.** This is the **fallback** for custom composition authoring. If the input clearly fits a specialized workflow, prefer it: marketed product → `/product-launch-video`; general site → `/website-to-video`; topic explainer → `/faceless-explainer`; GitHub PR → `/pr-to-video`; existing footage → `/embedded-captions` · `/talking-head-recut`; short unnarrated motion graphic → `/motion-graphics`; Remotion port → `/remotion-to-hyperframes`. **Out of scope**: live / at-render-time data, NLE-style editing of a finished video, or producing footage HyperFrames can't capture. Unsure? **Read `/hyperframes` first.**

**Build exactly what was asked.** A title card is a title card — not a title card + three supporting scenes + ambient music + captions. If extra scenes or elements would genuinely improve the piece, _propose_ them; don't add them silently. For small edits (fix a color, adjust one duration, add one element), skip the planning steps and go straight to the build.

## Approach

### Discovery — open-ended requests only

For vague, exploratory requests ("make something for our brand", "a cool intro") — understand intent before picking colors:

- **Audience** — who watches? developers / executives / general consumers?
- **Platform** — where does it play? social (15s) / website hero / product demo / internal?
- **Priority** — what matters most? motion quality / content accuracy / brand fidelity / speed?
- **Variations** — one best shot, or 2-3 meaningfully different options (different pacing, energy, or structure — not just color swaps)?

For specific requests ("add a title card", "fix the timing on scene 3"), skip discovery.

### Step 1 — Design system → `hyperframes-creative`

Establish the visual identity first. If the project has a design spec, read it (precedence `frame.md` → `design.md` → `DESIGN.md`; treat it as brand truth — exact colors, fonts, constraints).

**If no spec exists, you MUST read BOTH `hyperframes-creative/references/house-style.md` AND `hyperframes-creative/references/video-composition.md` before choosing any color or font.** `house-style.md` gives the "interpret the prompt / generate real content" opener, lazy-default list, and layer recipe; `video-composition.md` gives the video-medium density / scale / **foreground detailing** (data bars, registration marks, monospace metadata, "8-10 elements, two the user didn't ask for") that separates "produced" from "generated." Reading only one is the most common miss — `video-composition.md` is the one agents skip, and it is exactly the one that prevents flat, centered, web-page-looking output. Do not self-invent a palette and skip these; crossing into `hyperframes-creative` is mandatory here, not an optional branch. From there, also pull a named style/mood → `references/visual-styles.md`, or the interactive picker → `references/design-picker.md`, as needed. The spec/style defines the **brand**, not the composition rules.

**Find the angle (vague brief, no spec):** before picking colors, write ONE sentence — what does this name/word/topic evoke, and what visual _world_ (metaphor, setting, instrument, motif) expresses it? E.g. a cybersecurity tool → vault doors / perimeter scan lines / lock tumblers; a meditation app → tide, breath, slow light bloom. Read the _meaning_ of the subject, not just its letters; pick a concrete angle over a literal restyle. This is the cheap substitute for prompt expansion (Step 2) on single-scene pieces, where expansion is correctly skipped — and it is the difference between a designed concept and a generic logo-on-a-gradient.

<HARD-GATE>
Before writing ANY composition HTML, verify you have ALL FOUR:
1. **A visual identity** grounded in the spec or `house-style.md` — not invented on the spot. (Reaching for `#333`, `#3b82f6`, or `Roboto`? You skipped it.)
2. **A one-sentence concept angle** (the "find the angle" step) for anything beyond a trivial edit — not a literal restyle of the prompt words.
3. **A font pairing from the embed list** (`hyperframes-creative/references/typography.md` → "Fonts that embed") chosen on purpose — not `Inter`/`Helvetica Neue`/`system-ui` by default, and never an un-embedded display font you're just hoping renders (un-bundled names embed only if auto-captured locally — and cloud renders won't capture them).
4. **A foreground/density plan from `video-composition.md`** — the anchor-to-edges, 8-10-elements, foreground-metadata, background-texture rules. (Centered stack on a flat color with fewer than ~6 elements and no edge-anchored detail? You skipped it — that is the generic tell.)
</HARD-GATE>

### Step 2 — Prompt expansion → `hyperframes-creative`

Run for every multi-scene composition (skip for single-scene pieces and trivial edits). Ground the request against the design spec + house style into a consistent intermediate that downstream work reads the same way. See `hyperframes-creative/references/prompt-expansion.md`.

### Step 3 — Plan

Before writing HTML, think at a high level:

1. **What** — the viewer experience: narrative arc, key moments, emotional beats.
2. **Structure** — how many compositions, sub-comp vs inline, which tracks carry video / audio / overlays / captions. For the monolithic-single-file vs modular-sub-comp call, see `hyperframes-core/references/composition-patterns.md` § Two Architectures (rule of thumb: ≥3 hard scene cuts, or any reused scene → modularize; a short single-scene piece stays one file).
3. **Rhythm** — name the pattern before implementing (e.g. `fast-fast-SLOW-SHADER-hold`); see `hyperframes-creative/references/beat-direction.md`.
4. **Timing** — which clips drive duration, where transitions land, the pacing.
5. **Layout** — build the end state first (see below).
6. **Animate** — then add motion via `hyperframes-animation`.

## Layout Before Animation

Position every element where it sits at its **most visible moment** — fully entered, correctly placed, not yet exiting. Write that as static HTML + CSS first. **No GSAP yet.**

**Why:** if you position elements at their animated start state (offscreen, scaled to 0, opacity 0) and tween to where you _think_ they land, you are guessing the final layout — overlaps stay invisible until render. Build the end state first and you see and fix layout problems before adding motion.

1. **Identify the hero frame** for each scene — the moment the most elements are simultaneously visible. That is the layout you build.
2. **Write static CSS** for that frame. The content container must fill the scene with padding, not absolute offsets:

```css
.scene-content {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  padding: 120px 160px; /* padding positions content; fills any scene size */
  gap: 24px;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

Never use `position: absolute; top: Npx` on a content container — it overflows when content is taller than the space. Reserve absolute positioning for decoratives.

> ⚠ **The `width/height: 100%` above only resolves if every ancestor has a resolved height.** The root `<div data-composition-id>` and any wrapper between it and `.scene-content` must be sized (`position: relative; width: 1920px; height: 1080px` on the root — see `hyperframes-core` → "Root must be sized"). Skip this and the flex container collapses to ~0, content piles into the **top-left corner**, and the first glyph clips at x=0 — while `lint`/`inspect` still report 0 issues. And **always keep the `padding`** (≥80px) on `.scene-content`: it is the title-safe margin. Never replace it with bare `gap`.

3. **Add entrances** — animate FROM offscreen/invisible TO the CSS position with `gsap.from()` (in sub-compositions prefer `gsap.fromTo()` so the start state is explicit; see `hyperframes-core/references/sub-compositions.md`). The CSS position is ground truth; the tween is the journey to it.
4. **Exits are transition-handled** — per the scene-transition rules in `hyperframes-animation/transitions/`, only the **final** scene animates elements out; between scenes the transition IS the exit.

**Shared space across time:** if element A exits before element B enters in the same area, both still need correct CSS positions for their respective hero frames — timeline ordering keeps them from coexisting, and the layout step catches accidental overlap. Layered glows/shadows and z-stacked depth are _intentional_ overlap; the step is about catching _unintentional_ collisions (two headlines on top of each other, content bleeding off-frame).

## Build — delegate to the domain skills

This maps the skill's full surface (see the `description`) to its references — non-exhaustive; when an intent isn't listed, route through `hyperframes-creative` (look/concept), `hyperframes-animation` (motion), `hyperframes-core` (contract), `hyperframes-media` (audio/captions). **The first row is ADDITIVE — read it AND your intent row, not one or the other.**

### Audio: one engine (TTS · BGM · SFX)

Only when the piece calls for it (per "build exactly what was asked" — no ambient music on a title card). Don't hand-roll TTS or vendor a copy: write a neutral `audio_request.json` and call the shared engine in `hyperframes-media`. It auto-degrades on one switch — HeyGen credential present → HeyGen TTS + music/SFX **retrieval**; absent → ElevenLabs/Kokoro TTS, Lyria/MusicGen BGM **generation**, and the bundled SFX library. Full flag list + request/meta schema: the header comment of `hyperframes-media/scripts/audio.mjs`.

```jsonc
// audio_request.json — one line per narrated segment; `id` is yours (joins audio_meta back)
{
  "lines": [
    { "id": "s1", "text": "Your opening line.", "sfx": ["whoosh"] },
    { "id": "s2", "text": "The next beat." },
  ],
  "bgm": { "query": "calm cinematic underscore" }, // omit "mode" → auto (retrieve if HeyGen, else generate); "none" to disable
}
```

```bash
# <MEDIA_DIR> = the installed hyperframes-media skill dir (sibling of this skill)
node <MEDIA_DIR>/scripts/audio.mjs --request ./audio_request.json --hyperframes . --out ./audio_meta.json
```

Then read `audio_meta.json`: mount each `voices[].path` + (`bgm.path`, `sfx[]`) as `<audio>` tracks and use `voices[].words` for captions, all per `hyperframes-core` (audio tracks + caption authoring). If BGM took the generate path (`bgm_pending: true`), run `hyperframes-media/scripts/wait-bgm.mjs` before final render.

## Output checklist → `hyperframes-cli`

- [ ] `npx hyperframes lint` and `npx hyperframes validate` pass (block on results)
- [ ] design adherence verified if a spec (`frame.md` / `design.md`) exists — checklist in `hyperframes-creative/references/design-adherence.md`
- [ ] `npx hyperframes inspect` passes, or every overflow is intentionally marked
- [ ] contrast warnings addressed; for multi-scene work, review the animation map (`hyperframes-animation/scripts/animation-map.mjs`)
- [ ] deliver the preview; render to MP4 only on explicit request
- [ ] surface the preview **only at handoff** (it is the stable, final preview); don't pop one mid-build — build-phase snapshots are headless
