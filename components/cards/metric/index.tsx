 * TODO: This is currently a re-export from the original location.
 * The metric-card.tsx file (780 lines) needs to be properly split into:
 * - types.ts (already extracted)
 * - themes.ts (already extracted)
 * - icons.tsx (already extracted)
 * - skeleton.tsx (already extracted)
 * - variants/ (single.tsx, dual.tsx, list.tsx, etc.)
 *
 * For now, re-exporting from the original location to maintain compatibility.
