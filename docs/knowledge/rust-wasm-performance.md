# Rust and WASM Performance

## Decision

Keep object-heavy transforms in TypeScript. Use Rust/WASM only for JSON-preserving or byte/string-heavy paths where data can stay serialized across the JS/WASM boundary.

Do not promote native Rust subprocess transforms into hot API paths. Process startup and IPC overhead dominate the benchmark for small and medium inputs.

## Why

Benchmark evidence from PR #1021 showed:
- JSONEachRow normalization reached roughly parity to 1.2x faster
- User-event object pivots were much slower in WASM v1/v2/v3
- Rust CLI subprocess transforms not viable for hot browser/API paths

## How to Apply

- Re-run `bun run bench:wasm` after changing `rust/monitor-core`, `lib/wasm/monitor-core.ts`, or `scripts/bench-wasm.ts`
- Keep the promotion threshold at 1.20x
- Preserve lazy loading for the WASM bundle — do not add it to default dashboard or client bundles
- For `tools/ch-monitor-cli`, keep TUI refresh cadence bounded (one chart fetch every 5s)

| Candidate | Size | TS ms | Candidate ms | Speedup | Promote |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| clickhouse-jsoneachrow-to-objects | large | 183.30 | 205.58 | 0.89x | no |

| chart-api-response-envelope | large | 190.31 | 164.56 | 1.16x | no |
| clickhouse-jsoneachrow-native-cli | large | 176.85 | 148.65 | 1.19x | no |

## Artifacts

- `scripts/bench-wasm.ts` — benchmark runner
- `scripts/build-wasm.ts` — WASM build script
- `rust/monitor-core` — Rust source
- `lib/wasm/monitor-core.ts` — JS bindings
- `lib/wasm/generated/monitor_core_bg.wasm` — compiled WASM
