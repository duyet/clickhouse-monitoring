# Cloudflare Workers Secret Rotation

## Rule

After running `wrangler secret put` (or `bun run cf:config`), you **MUST redeploy** to flush the connection pool cache.

## Why

ClickHouse client instances are pooled and cached at runtime. When secrets are updated via Wrangler, the running Worker still uses the old credentials from the connection pool until a new deployment replaces the instance.

## How to Apply

```bash
# Update secrets
bun run cf:config

# MUST redeploy after
bun run cf:deploy
```
