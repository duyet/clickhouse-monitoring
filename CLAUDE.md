# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Git Commit Convention

**IMPORTANT**: All commits should include the co-authorship:
```
Co-Authored-By: duyetbot <bot@duyet.net>
```

Use semantic commit format with consistent scope for commit messages and PR titles. Keep wording simple.

## PR Workflow

**Always auto-babysit PRs on this project.** After opening any PR, immediately arm
auto-merge (`gh pr merge --auto --squash`) and babysit it (`/github:babysit-pr`):
watch CI, fix failures, confirm the merge and production deploy. Do NOT ask the
user whether to babysit — just do it. Known non-required checks (`e2e-test`,
`e2e-test-tsr`, `component-test`, `unit-tests`) do not block auto-merge.

**Stale bot-review gate (authorized override).** When a bot reviewer
(CodeRabbit / `coderabbitai[bot]`, Sourcery, Gemini) leaves a
`CHANGES_REQUESTED` that blocks merge, you are authorized to dismiss it and merge
**only when ALL of these hold**: every actionable point it raised is genuinely
fixed (or was stale / referenced pre-fix code), **all required CI checks are
green**, the branch is up to date with `main`, and the bot did not re-review
after you triggered it (push a new commit, then `@coderabbitai review` /
`@coderabbitai full review`, then a formal re-request — give it a few minutes).
Dismiss with
`gh api -X PUT repos/chmonitor/chmonitor/pulls/<n>/reviews/<id>/dismissals -f event=DISMISS -f message="<why each point is addressed>"`
(bot reviews use the `coderabbitai[bot]` login; there may be more than one to
dismiss). Do NOT dismiss a human reviewer's changes-requested, and never dismiss
to skip an unaddressed finding. To avoid the gate entirely, prefer
`request_changes_workflow: false` in CodeRabbit config so it only comments.

## Project Overview

This is a monorepo ClickHouse monitoring dashboard. The primary (and only) dashboard app is `apps/dashboard` (TanStack Start, as of v0.3). The Next.js migration is complete — the TanStack Start app has replaced the legacy Next.js app and is now at `apps/dashboard`. The application connects to ClickHouse instances and provides real-time insights into clusters through system tables — metrics, query performance, table information, and cluster health.

## One codebase: Self-hosted (OSS) + Cloud (SaaS)

`dash.chmonitor.dev` is the **Cloud (SaaS)** product; Docker / Kubernetes / a
self-built Cloudflare Worker are the **self-hosted (OSS)** product. They are the
SAME codebase — the difference is purely runtime configuration. The split is the
**cloud-mode** flag (`lib/cloud/cloud-mode.ts`).

**Design invariant (fail-closed to self-hosted):** an unset/junk
`CHM_CLOUD_MODE` / `VITE_CLOUD_MODE` resolves to NOT cloud, so the OSS build is
never degraded. Cloud behaviour is purely additive. Mirrors `lib/edition` (which
already lists `cloud` as an enterprise feature) and its fail-open philosophy.

| Aspect | Self-hosted (default) | Cloud (`CHM_CLOUD_MODE=true`) |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| `CLICKHOUSE_HOST` env hosts | The operator's real hosts, full access | A **public read-only demo** (`source: 'demo'`, e.g. `duet-ubuntu`) |
| Anonymous visitor | Sees env hosts | Sees the read-only demo (explore without an account) |
| Signed-in user | Sees env hosts | Demo is **hidden** ("empty it") → their own per-user (D1) connections only; zero → welcome/setup page |
| Auth | usually `none` | Clerk, with `CHM_CLERK_PUBLIC_READ=true` (anon reads, writes need sign-in) |
| Per-user connections | optional | on (`CHM_FEATURE_USER_CONNECTIONS_DB=true`) |

**Environment is centralized — one canonical name, one source of truth.** Each
dual-surface setting (browser + server) has ONE canonical `CHM_*` name; the
client `VITE_*` is DERIVED from it in `vite.config.ts`, so you set each value
ONCE (e.g. set `CHM_AUTH_PROVIDER`, never also `VITE_AUTH_PROVIDER`). The hosted
product's non-secret config lives in committed `apps/dashboard/.env.cloud`
(+ `.env.preview` overlay) — the SINGLE source for both the vite client build
(`CHM_BUILD_ENV=cloud|preview`, npm `build:cloud`/`build:preview`) and the Worker
runtime vars. `wrangler.toml` declares NO `[vars]`; `scripts/patch-wrangler-env.ts`
injects them from `.env.cloud` at deploy. Self-hosters use `apps/dashboard/.env.example`
(same names) on Docker (`docker-compose.yml` `env_file`) / K8s (Helm `values.yaml`).
Secrets NEVER live in committed `.env*` — only in `scripts/set-secrets.ts` / a
K8s Secret / `.env.local`. **Never re-add a `[vars]` block to `wrangler.toml` —
edit `.env.cloud`.**

**Where cloud mode is wired:**
- `lib/cloud/cloud-mode.ts` — `isCloudModeClient()` / `isCloudModeServer()` / `parseCloudMode()`.
- `apps/dashboard/.env.cloud` (+ `.env.preview`) — single source: `CHM_CLOUD_MODE=true`, `CHM_FEATURE_USER_CONNECTIONS_DB=true`, etc.
- `vite.config.ts` `loadDeployEnv` + CLIENT_ENV + `src/vite-env.d.ts` — derive/inline `VITE_CLOUD_MODE` (build) from the canonical `CHM_*`.
- `scripts/patch-wrangler-env.ts` — reads `.env.cloud`/`.env.preview` → Worker runtime `[vars]` (the @cloudflare/vite-plugin strips `[vars]` from the generated config).
- `.github/workflows/cloudflare.yml` build step — runs `build:preview` (PRs) / `build:cloud` (main); values come from the `.env*` files, not hardcoded.
- `lib/swr/use-merged-hosts.ts` — demo tagging + hide-when-signed-in; returns `cloudMode` / `isSignedIn`.
- `components/host/host-switcher.tsx` — "Demo / read-only" badges; treats `demo` like `env` for live status.
- `components/host/first-run-empty-state.tsx` — the redesigned welcome/setup page (3 modes: cloud signed-in, cloud anon, self-hosted).

**Connection-error help:** `lib/connection-errors.ts` classifies "Test connection"
failures (host_not_allowed/SSRF, invalid_url, auth_failed, access_denied,
dns/refused/tls/timeout) into title + cause + fix + docs slug. Rendered by
`ConnectionErrorPanel` in `connection-form.tsx`. Docs page:
`docs/content/guide/guides/connection-errors.mdx` (slug `guides/connection-errors`).

**Self-hosted stays whole:** never gate a core monitoring feature behind cloud
mode. Cloud-only behaviour = demo hosts + welcome framing + per-user storage,
nothing that removes functionality from OSS.

## Claude Skills

### chmonitor Agent Skill

For comprehensive dashboard knowledge, use the standalone agent skill:

```bash
npx skills add chmonitor/chmonitor
```

The skill covers:
- Dashboard navigation and features
- API endpoints and usage
- Query monitoring, table management, merge operations
- Development patterns and conventions
- ClickHouse version compatibility

**Repository**: https://github.com/chmonitor/chmonitor

### Internal: clickhouse-query-config

For version-aware query patterns:
- `sql: VersionedSql[]` with `since` field
- BackgroundBar column format (base, readable_column, pct_column)
- ClickHouse system table schema compatibility

**Quick Reference: BackgroundBar Columns**

When asked to "format background bar for: X, Y, Z", each column needs 3 SQL columns:
```sql
-- For "rows"
rows,                                                                    -- base
formatReadableQuantity(rows) AS readable_rows,                           -- display
round(rows * 100.0 / nullIf(max(rows) OVER (), 0), 2) AS pct_rows       -- percentage
```

See `.claude/skills/clickhouse-query-config.md` for full patterns.

## Project skills (Claude Code) & auto-improvement

Project-local Claude Code skills live in `.claude/skills/` as real `SKILL.md`
dirs (NOT `.agents/skills/`, which the `build:skills` registry scans for
end-user AI-agent skills — keep dev/product skills out of there so they never
leak into the agent bundle). Current dev skills:

- **`product-design`** — design system + UX conventions; read it before building
  or reviewing ANY UI so new features stay consistent. Backed by
  `docs/knowledge/product-design.md`.
- **`cloud-saas-mode`** — Cloud (SaaS) vs self-hosted behaviour, demo hosts,
  welcome/setup, per-user connections, connection-error classifier. Backed by
  `docs/knowledge/cloud-saas-mode.md`.

**Auto-improve project skills (standing instruction).** These skills are living
documents — keep them accurate as the codebase evolves, without being asked:

1. Whenever you add or change a durable UI pattern, design token, reusable
   component, onboarding/error convention, or cloud-vs-OSS behaviour, UPDATE the
   relevant skill **and** its `docs/knowledge/*.md` backing doc **in the same
   change** (treat a skill that drifts from the code as a bug).
2. Bump the `updated:` date in the knowledge doc; keep the skill `description`
   trigger list current so it still activates for the right requests.
3. When you discover a new cross-cutting convention worth enforcing, add it to
   the appropriate skill (or create a new `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`), then
   link it from this section and the Knowledge Graph table below.
4. Never commit a regenerated `apps/dashboard/src/lib/ai/agent/skills/registry.ts`
   as a side effect of dev-skill work — that file tracks AI-agent skills only.

## Knowledge Graph

Developer-facing docs live in `docs/knowledge/` as a linked knowledge graph. Each note has frontmatter (`id`, `type`, `related`, `tags`) and cross-links to connected notes.

**Discovery order**: CLAUDE.md → [docs/knowledge/README.md](docs/knowledge/README.md) → `grep -r "keyword" docs/knowledge/`

### When to Write to Knowledge vs Memory

- **Write to `docs/knowledge/`**: rules, conventions, architecture decisions, past incidents, "always do X" instructions, non-obvious workflows
- **Write to session memory**: user profile, transient preferences, ephemeral task state

When the user says **"remember"** something — write it to `docs/knowledge/`, not memory. Memory is per-instance and invisible to teammates. Knowledge docs are versioned, grep-able, and indexed here.

## Commands

**Note: This project uses `bun` as the package manager.** Use `bun` instead of `pnpm` or `npm` for all commands.

### Setup

- `bun install` - Install all dependencies (required before dev/build). Bun is enforced by the `preinstall` hook, and `prepare` installs Husky hooks.

### Development

- `bun run dev` - Start development server (Vite dev, via turbo)
- `bun run build` - Build for production (Vite build + tsc --noEmit)
- `bun run start` - Start production server (node target)

**Verification workflow:** After making changes, always run `bun run build` to catch type errors. The build includes TypeScript type checking via `tsc --noEmit`. If `node_modules/` is missing, run `bun install` first.

### Testing

- `bun run test` - Run the full Bun test suite
- `bun run test:unit` - Run targeted unit tests for core app/component suites
- `bun run test:query-config` - Run query-config-specific tests
- `bun run test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage output
- `bun run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- `bun run test:component` - Open Cypress component tests
- `bun run test:component:headless` - Run Cypress component tests headless
- `bun run test:e2e` - Open Cypress e2e tests
- `bun run test:e2e:headless` - Run Cypress e2e tests headless

### Code Quality

- `bun run lint` - Run Biome linting
- `bun run fmt` - Format code with Biome
- `bun run depcruise` - Validate dependency boundaries (no cycles, layering, no packages→apps)
- If Biome CLI and `biome.json` schema versions drift, run `biome migrate` before linting changes.

### Deployment

#### Unified Deploy Script (CI + Local)

The same deploy command works in both CI and local environments:

```bash
cd apps/dashboard && bun run cf:deploy
```

This runs inside `apps/dashboard` and executes:

1. Vite build (CF target via `@cloudflare/vite-plugin`)
2. `wrangler deploy --minify` — Deploy to the `chmonitor-dash` worker at `dash.chmonitor.dev`

No OpenNext, no KV/R2/D1 cache population step — the TanStack Start build produces a native Workers bundle directly.

**Auth**: Set `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` in your environment (CI secrets or `.env.prod`).
Falls back to `wrangler login` OAuth for local development.

#### Cloudflare Workers Commands

- `cd apps/dashboard && bun run cf:deploy` — Build + deploy to Cloudflare Workers
- `bun run cf:config` — Set Cloudflare secrets from `.env.prod` or `.env.local`
- `cd apps/dashboard && bun run cf-typegen` — Regenerate Cloudflare environment typings

#### Docker Deployment

- `docker compose up -d` — Quick start
- `bun run docker:health` — Check Docker health

#### Prerequisites

Both environments need these env vars (set via `.env.prod`, `.env.local`, or CI secrets):

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` | For deploy | Cloudflare API token (recommended over OAuth) |
| `CLICKHOUSE_HOST` | Yes | ClickHouse URL |
| `CLICKHOUSE_USER` | Yes | ClickHouse username |
| `CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD` | Yes | ClickHouse password |

Optional: `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`, LLM API keys, `CLICKHOUSE_TZ`, etc.

#### CI Environment (GitHub Actions)

Production deploys happen on push to `main`. The CI workflow in
`.github/workflows/cloudflare.yml` builds `apps/dashboard` (TanStack Start) and
deploys it using the same env var names — just sourced from GitHub Secrets instead
of local files.

### Additional Workflows

- `bun run check` / `bun run check:fix` - Run Biome's full check suite, with optional write mode
- `bun run lint:fix` - Apply Biome lint fixes
- `bun run type-check` - Run standalone TypeScript verification
- `bun run test:unit`, `bun run test:query-config`, `bun run test:coverage` - Narrow test runs for common workflows
- `bun run build:skills` - Regenerate the AI skills registry from `.agents/skills/`
- `bun run scripts/build-ch-schema-docs.ts` - Regenerate ClickHouse schema docs (`--version`, `--table`, `--verbose`)
- `bun scripts/set-secrets.ts` - Set Cloudflare Worker secrets directly (same operation as `bun run cf:config`)
- `bun run docker:health` / `bun run cf:health` - Check Docker or deployed health endpoints
- `bun run lint && bun run build` - Quick local CI parity check (matches core lint/build workflow jobs)
- Code-smell/dead-code automation: see [docs/knowledge/core-memory.md](docs/knowledge/core-memory.md)
- Since-last-run scan scope: `git log --since='<ISO_TIME>' --name-only --pretty=format: | sed '/^$/d' | sort -u`
- Since-last-run scan scope (source commits only): `git log --since='<ISO_TIME>' --no-merges --name-only --pretty=format: | sed '/^$/d' | sort -u`
- Fallback scan (24h): `git log --since='24 hours ago' --name-only --pretty=format: | sed '/^$/d' | sort -u`
- Fallback scan (7d): `git log --since='7 days ago' --name-only --pretty=format: | sed '/^$/d' | sort -u`
- Empty-window rule: if since-last-run has zero commits, run 24h then 7d fallback and report no-op when both are empty
- Dead-code evidence: `rg -n "\b<SYMBOL>\b" --glob '!**/__tests__/**' --glob '!**/*.test.*' --glob '!**/*.spec.*'`
- Main CI status check: `gh run list --branch main --limit 10 --json workflowName,status,conclusion,headSha,url`
- PR CI status check: `gh pr checks <PR_NUMBER> --watch=false`
- Failed-job logs in restricted cache environments: `XDG_CACHE_HOME=/private/tmp/gh-cache gh run view <RUN_ID> --job <JOB_ID> --log-failed`
- E2E page-load flake triage: `XDG_CACHE_HOME=/private/tmp/gh-cache gh run view <RUN_ID> --job <JOB_ID> --log-failed | grep -n -E "Timed out after waiting .* for your remote page to load"`
- Worktree fallback for PR operations: if automation checkout is detached (`git status --short --branch` shows `HEAD (no branch)`), stale versus `origin/main`, or git metadata writes fail (`FETCH_HEAD`/`HEAD.lock`/`index.lock`), run `git -C /Users/duet/project/clickhouse-monitor fetch origin`; if that checkout is dirty, create a clean worktree under `/private/tmp` for commit/PR commands
- Cloudflare worker size dry-run: `bun wrangler deploy --minify --dry-run`
- Code-smell automation workflow now records findings in `docs/knowledge/core-memory.md`, then validates `gh run list --branch main --limit 10 ...` and keeps a dedicated memory note under `/Users/duet/.codex/automations/code-smell-detector/memory.md`.

**Docs content workflow**: `docs/content/**` is the committed source of truth for the docs. The standalone Astro **Starlight** site at `apps/docs` (→ docs.chmonitor.dev) generates its content collection from it via `scripts/sync-docs.mjs` on every build. There is no per-release versioning.

- `cd apps/docs && bun run dev` - Preview the docs site locally (http://localhost:4321)
- `cd apps/docs && bun run build` - Full static build (sync-docs → astro build incl. Pagefind)
- Edit only `docs/content/**`; `apps/docs/src/content/docs/**` is regenerated and gitignored.

**IMPORTANT — keep the AI Agent docs in sync**: `docs/content/ai-agent.mdx` is
the user-facing reference for the agent's tools, skills, and configuration.
Whenever you add, rename, or remove an agent tool (`lib/ai/agent/tools/*.ts`), a
skill (`.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md`), or an agent env var, update
`docs/content/ai-agent.mdx` in the same change so the docs do not drift.

## Architecture

> **NOTE:** `apps/dashboard` is now the TanStack Start app (v0.3+). The Next.js migration is complete. For the app internals, see `apps/dashboard/CLAUDE.md` or `docs/PRD.md` §10.2. The Next.js-era subsections below are kept as historical reference and no longer apply.

### Core Technologies (TanStack Start, current)

- **TanStack Start** (TanStack Router, file-based routing, SSR-capable)
- **Vite** with `@cloudflare/vite-plugin` — native Cloudflare Workers bundle
- **React 19** with TypeScript
- **TanStack Query** for server-state, caching, and data fetching
- **TanStack Table** for data tables
- **ClickHouse clients** (@clickhouse/client and @clickhouse/client-web)
- **Tailwind v4** with shadcn/ui components
- **Recharts 3.x** for charts
- **Vercel AI SDK** + assistant-ui for the AI agent

Deployment: Cloudflare Workers (`chmonitor-dash` worker → `dash.chmonitor.dev`), Docker, or Kubernetes.

### Static-First Rendering (TanStack Start)

Pages are prerendered at build time (static shell) with client-side data fetching via TanStack Query. The Worker SSR layer handles auth and API routes.

- All dashboard pages are file-based routes under `src/routes/(dashboard)/`
- API routes live at `src/routes/api/`
- Multi-host routing via `?host=0` query param (unchanged from v0.2)

---

### Legacy: Next.js Static Site Architecture (historical reference — no longer in use)

**CRITICAL**: Fully static site. No SSR, no middleware, no server components. Client-side only.

- Use `'use client'` for all pages
- Use client-side redirect (`useRouter` + `useEffect`), never `redirect()` from next/navigation
- Use SWR for all data fetching
- Query params for routing (`?host=0`), not dynamic routes

### Legacy: Routing Pattern

**Old (Dynamic)**: `https://example.com/0/overview`
**New (Static)**: `https://example.com/overview?host=0`

**Benefits:**
- Faster initial page load (static shell pre-rendered)
- Better CDN caching (static pages cache at edge)
- Simpler deployment (standalone output)
- Progressive data loading (client fetches data independently)

### Multi-Host Support

**IMPORTANT**: All data fetching now requires `hostId` parameter.

**Query Parameter Approach:**
```typescript
// URL: /overview?host=1
'use client'
import { OverviewCharts } from '@/components/overview-charts/overview-charts-client'

export default function OverviewPage() {
  // OverviewCharts and its child components use useHostId() internally
  return <OverviewCharts />
}
```

**Environment Variables:**
- `CLICKHOUSE_HOST` - Comma-separated list of hosts
- `CLICKHOUSE_USER` - Comma-separated list of users
- `CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD` - Comma-separated list of passwords
- `CLICKHOUSE_NAME` - Comma-separated list of custom names

### Key Patterns

#### SWR Data Fetching Pattern

**All client components that fetch data follow this pattern:**

```typescript
'use client'
import { Suspense } from 'react'
import { useHostId } from '@/lib/swr'
import { ChartSkeleton } from '@/components/skeletons'
import { YourChart } from '@/components/charts/your-chart'

export default function YourPage() {
  const hostId = useHostId()

  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<ChartSkeleton />}>
      <YourChart hostId={hostId} />
    </Suspense>
  )
}
```

**Chart Components:**
```typescript
'use client'
import useSWR from 'swr'
import { useChartData } from '@/lib/swr/use-chart-data'

export function YourChart({ hostId }: { hostId: number }) {
  const { data, error, isLoading } = useChartData({
    name: 'your-chart-name',
    hostId,
    interval: 300000, // 5 minutes
  })

  if (isLoading) return <ChartSkeleton />
  if (error) return <ChartError error={error} />
  // ... render chart
}
```

#### Data Table System

The `components/data-table/` directory contains a sophisticated table system:

- **Column definitions** with custom formatting (badges, links, duration, etc.)
- **Column resizing** with draggable borders
- **Text wrapping** toggle for long content
- **Sorting** with custom sorting functions
- **Pagination** and **filtering**
- **Actions** for row-level operations
- **SQL display** showing the underlying query
- Synthetic utility column ids are `__expand`, `select`, and `action`; treat them as non-data columns when wiring client-side filter, search, sort, or card controls.

#### Query Configuration

Each data view uses a `QueryConfig` type that defines:

- SQL query with parameters
- Column formatting specifications
- Sorting and filtering options
- Actions available for each row

#### Chart Components

The project uses custom chart components with consistent patterns:

- **Area charts** - Time-series data with gradients (merge operations, query counts)
- **Bar charts** - Categorical data with tooltips (top tables by size, query counts)
- **Progress bars** - Replaced donut charts for percentage-based metrics (query cache, query types)
- **Donut/Radial charts** - Circular metrics for system resources (CPU, memory, disk)
- **Custom charts** - Specialized visualizations (connections, ZooKeeper metrics)

**Chart Refactoring**: Donut charts have been replaced with progress bars for better readability in percentage-based displays (query cache usage, query type distribution).

**Collapsible chart sections**: when a page hides an auto-refreshing chart strip, unmount the chart subtree instead of only collapsing it with CSS. Otherwise the hidden charts keep polling and rendering in the background. TanStack Query's 30-minute `gcTime` keeps reopen fast without paying that hidden-work cost.

#### Request Info (SQL) Dialog
- **Beautify SQL**: Disabled by default to prevent slow rendering of very large queries. Users can toggle it on manually.
- **Design**: Uses native shadcn/ui components (`Badge`, `Separator`, `ScrollArea`) for a premium look and consistent UI.

#### Agent Session Metrics
- **Location**: Agent settings sidebar.
- **Features**: Real-time monitoring of tokens (input/output), estimated cost, and tool calls.
- **Analytics Dialog**: Detailed breakdown of session analytics available via a premium dialog.
- **Usage**: Automatically aggregates metrics from AI SDK messages using `useAgentSessionStats`.

#### Graceful Error Handling Pattern

Charts use graceful error handling during SWR revalidation to preserve user experience:

- **Initial load errors**: Show full `ChartError` component with retry button
- **Revalidation errors**: Keep showing existing data with subtle amber indicator
- **Indicator behavior**: Hidden by default, visible on card hover (same pattern as CardToolbar)
- **Error details**: Click indicator to see error type, message, timestamp, and retry button
- **Auto-recovery**: Indicator clears automatically when next refresh succeeds

**Implementation**:
- `useChartData` returns `staleError` (revalidation error) and `hasData` boolean
- `ChartContainer` only shows `ChartError` when `error && !hasData`
- `ChartCard` renders `ChartStaleIndicator` when `staleError` exists
- Icon order in header: `[Stale Indicator] [DateRangeSelector] [CardToolbar]`

### Development Conventions

#### shadcn/ui Components

**IMPORTANT: Never customize `components/ui/` files directly.**

The `components/ui/` directory contains shadcn/ui components installed via the CLI. These should remain in their original state to:
- Allow easy updates via `npx shadcn@latest add <component>`
- Maintain consistency with shadcn/ui documentation
- Avoid merge conflicts when updating components

**Guidelines:**
1. **Don't add custom variants** (e.g., `success`, `warning`, `info`) to base components like Badge or Alert
2. **Don't add hover effects** or animations to Card, Table, or other base components
3. **Don't modify base styling** - use className prop at usage site instead

**If you need custom styling or variants:**
- Pass custom classes via `className` prop where the component is used
- Create a wrapper component in `components/` (not `components/ui/`)
- Use Tailwind's `cn()` utility to merge classes

**Example - Custom styling at usage site:**
```typescript
// Good: Custom classes passed where used
<Card className="hover:shadow-lg transition-all">
  <CardContent>...</CardContent>
</Card>

// Bad: Modifying components/ui/card.tsx directly
```

**Example - Creating a wrapper component:**
```typescript
// components/info-badge.tsx
import { Badge } from '@/components/ui/badge'
import { cn } from '@/lib/utils'

export function InfoBadge({ className, ...props }) {
  return (
    <Badge
      className={cn(
        'border-transparent bg-blue-100 text-blue-800 dark:bg-blue-900/30 dark:text-blue-300',
        className
      )}
      {...props}
    />
  )
}
```

#### File Organization

- Server components use `.tsx` without "use client"
- Client components explicitly use "use client" directive
- Page components are in `app/[...]/page.tsx`
- Layout components are in `app/[...]/layout.tsx`
- Config files are named `config.ts` within route directories

#### Component Patterns

- Use Server Components by default
- Client components for interactivity (context, state management)
- Compound components for complex UI (e.g., data tables)
- Custom hooks for shared logic
- **Hooks at deepest consumer**: Use hooks (like `useHostId`, `useSWR`) at the component that actually needs the data, NOT at parent levels. Avoid prop drilling through intermediate components. Example: `CountBadge` calls `useHostId()` internally rather than receiving `hostId` as a prop from `NavMain → MenuGroup → MenuItem`.

#### Query Patterns

- All queries include `QUERY_COMMENT` for identification
- Use `fetchData` function for consistent error handling and logging
- Query parameters are properly sanitized through `query_params`
- **CRITICAL**: `fetchData` now requires `hostId` parameter (not optional)
- Client components use SWR hooks for data fetching
- Server components can use API routes for data fetching

#### ClickHouse Version Compatibility

**IMPORTANT**: ClickHouse system tables change between versions. See `docs/clickhouse-schemas/` for:

- **Schema documentation** per version (`v23.8.md`, `v24.1.md`, etc.)
- **Column availability matrix** per table (`tables/query_log.md`, etc.)
- **Version-aware query patterns** with `since` field

**When modifying query configs:**
1. Check `docs/clickhouse-schemas/tables/{table}.md` for column availability
2. Use chronological `sql` array if columns differ across versions:

```typescript
export const myConfig: QueryConfig = {
  name: 'my-query',
  sql: [
    { since: '23.8', sql: `SELECT col1 FROM system.table` },
    { since: '24.1', sql: `SELECT col1, new_col FROM system.table` },
  ],
  columns: ['col1', 'new_col'],
}
```

**Regenerate schema docs:**
```bash
bun run scripts/build-ch-schema-docs.ts
```

See also: `.claude/skills/clickhouse-query-config.md` for Claude skill guidance.

#### Table Validation System

The application includes a robust table validation system to handle optional ClickHouse system tables that may not exist depending on configuration:

**Optional Tables** (marked with `optional: true`):

- `system.backup_log` - Only exists if backup configuration is enabled
- `system.error_log` - Requires error logging configuration
- `system.zookeeper` - Only available if ZooKeeper/ClickHouse Keeper is configured
- `system.monitoring_events` - Custom table created by the monitoring application

**Key Components**:

- `lib/table-validator.ts` - Validates table existence before queries
- `lib/table-existence-cache.ts` - Caches validation results (5-minute TTL)
- `lib/error-utils.ts` - Provides user-friendly error messages

**Usage Pattern**:

```typescript
export const backupsConfig: QueryConfig = {
  name: 'backups',
  optional: true, // Mark as optional
  tableCheck: 'system.backup_log', // Explicit table to check
  sql: 'SELECT * FROM system.backup_log',
  // ... other config
}
```

**Automatic Features**:

- SQL parsing automatically extracts table names from complex queries
- Handles JOINs, subqueries, CTEs, and EXISTS clauses
- Graceful error handling with informative user messages
- Caching prevents repeated validation calls

#### Testing Strategy

- **Bun test** for unit and query-config tests (`bun run test`, `bun run test:unit`, `bun run test:query-config`)
- **Cypress** for component and e2e tests
- **Query-config tests** run with `bun run test:query-config` against ClickHouse service containers in CI
- Component tests include visual regression testing
- Test files are co-located with components (`.cy.tsx` files)

## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

- `CLICKHOUSE_HOST` - ClickHouse host(s)
- `CLICKHOUSE_USER` - ClickHouse user(s)
- `CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD` - ClickHouse password(s)

### Optional Environment Variables

- `CLICKHOUSE_NAME` - Custom names for hosts
- `CLICKHOUSE_MAX_EXECUTION_TIME` - Query timeout (default: 60s)
- `VITE_TELEMETRY_ENABLED` - Enable opt-in product telemetry (off by default)
- `VITE_DEPLOY_TARGET` - Deployment target dimension for telemetry (`docker|helm|cf|dev|unknown`)

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Static Route

1. Create directory in `app/` (e.g., `app/your-route/`)
2. Create `page.tsx` as client component using `useHostId()`
3. Add `QueryConfig` to `lib/query-config/` if needed
4. Add menu item to `menu.ts` with href `/your-route`
5. Use SWR hooks for data fetching

**Template:**
```typescript
// app/your-route/page.tsx
'use client'

import { Suspense } from 'react'
import { RelatedCharts, Table } from '@/components'
import { ChartSkeleton, TableSkeleton } from '@/components/skeletons'
import { useHostId } from '@/lib/swr'
import { yourConfig } from '@/lib/query-config'

export default function YourRoutePage() {
  const hostId = useHostId()

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
      <Suspense fallback={<ChartSkeleton />}>
        <RelatedCharts relatedCharts={yourConfig.relatedCharts} hostId={hostId} />
      </Suspense>
      <Suspense fallback={<TableSkeleton />}>
        <Table title="Your Data" queryConfig={yourConfig} />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Adding a New Chart Component

1. Create component in `components/charts/your-chart.tsx`
2. Define SQL query in `lib/query-config/` if not exists
3. Use SWR `useChartData` hook with `hostId` prop
4. Handle loading, error, and empty states
5. Export and use in pages or related charts

**Template:**
```typescript
// components/charts/your-chart.tsx
'use client'

import { useChartData } from '@/lib/swr/use-chart-data'
import { ChartSkeleton } from '@/components/skeletons'
import { ChartError } from '@/components/error-alert'

interface YourChartProps {
  hostId: number
  interval?: number
}

export function YourChart({ hostId, interval }: YourChartProps) {
  const { data, error, isLoading } = useChartData({
    name: 'your-chart-name',
    hostId,
    interval,
  })

  if (isLoading) return <ChartSkeleton />
  if (error) return <ChartError error={error} />
  if (!data || data.length === 0) return <div>No data available</div>

  // Render your chart using data
  return <div>{/* Chart rendering */}</div>
}
```

### Modifying Data Tables

- Column formatters are in `components/data-table/cells/`
- Sorting functions are in `components/data-table/sorting-fns.ts`
- Actions are defined in `components/data-table/cells/actions/`

### Working with ClickHouse Queries

- Use `fetchData` for consistent error handling
- All queries should include proper parameter sanitization
- Log query performance through built-in logging
- Use appropriate data formats (JSONEachRow, JSON, etc.)
- **Always pass `hostId` parameter** (required, not optional)

## Important Files

### Core Application
- `next.config.ts` - Next.js configuration (standalone output mode)
- `app/layout.tsx` - Root layout with SWR provider and Suspense
- `app/page.tsx` - Root redirect to `/overview?host=0`
- `components/header-client.tsx` - Client-side header with host selector

### Data Layer
- `lib/clickhouse.ts` - ClickHouse client and `fetchData` (hostId required)
- `lib/swr/use-host.ts` - Extract hostId from query params
- `lib/swr/use-chart-data.ts` - SWR hook for chart data
- `lib/swr/use-table-data.ts` - SWR hook for table data
- `lib/api/chart-registry.ts` - Chart query registry
- `lib/query-config/index.ts` - Centralized query configurations

### Configuration
- `menu.ts` - Navigation menu configuration (static routes)
- `.env.local` - Environment variables for ClickHouse hosts

### Types
- `lib/api/types.ts` - API request/response types
- `types/query-config.ts` - Query configuration types

## Migration Notes

### Completed (Dec 2024)
- Migrated from dynamic `app/[host]/*` routes to static routes with `?host=` query parameter
- All 32 chart components converted to use SWR with `hostId` prop
- API routes created at `/api/v1/*` for data fetching
- Query configs centralized in `lib/query-config/`

### Breaking Changes
- URL structure changed: `/0/overview` → `/overview?host=0`
- `fetchData()` now requires `hostId` parameter (was optional)
- All data fetching moved to client-side via SWR

### Deployment
- Build mode: `output: 'standalone'` (hybrid static + API)
- Deploy to Cloudflare Workers: `npx wrangler login` then `bun run cf:deploy`

## AI Agents

The agent subsystem lives at `apps/dashboard/src/lib/ai/agent/` and is built on the **Vercel AI SDK** (not LangGraph). It has 29+ tool categories (schema, query, diagnostics, anomaly, cluster, visualization, etc.) assembled by `tools/index.ts`. Agent prompts are in `lib/ai/agent/prompts/`, skills in `lib/ai/agent/skills/`, and workflows in `lib/ai/agent/workflows/`.

For the agent environment variables and configuration, see `apps/dashboard/src/lib/ai/agent/` or `docs/content/ai-agent.mdx`.
