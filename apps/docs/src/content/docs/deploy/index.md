Deploy chmonitor wherever your ClickHouse runs. Pick the platform that matches your infrastructure; each platform page is self-contained with install steps, all config categories, and migration notes.

## Platforms

| Platform | Best for | Auth options | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Docker](/deploy/docker) | Single-server self-host | none / clerk / proxy | Fastest path; pin a release tag |
| [Kubernetes](/deploy/k8s) | Cluster-managed, multi-replica | none / clerk / proxy | Helm chart vendored in-repo; kustomize alternative |
| [Cloudflare Workers](/deploy/cloudflare) | Edge / serverless | none / clerk / Cloudflare Access | D1 + Durable Objects for conversation store; Cron Trigger for health sweep |
| [Vercel](/deploy/vercel) | Quick hosted preview (Next.js legacy app) | none / clerk / API key / reverse proxy | Use postgres or clickhouse for conversation store; no D1/DO |
| [Node / standalone](/deploy/self-host) | Custom server, systemd, bare VM | none / clerk / proxy | `bun run start` or `node server.js`; put behind nginx |

## Configuration categories

Every platform shares the same configuration categories. The links below go to the reference page for each.
