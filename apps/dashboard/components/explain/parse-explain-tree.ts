/**
 * Parse ClickHouse EXPLAIN text output into a nested tree.
 *
 * EXPLAIN PLAN and EXPLAIN PIPELINE return a hierarchical structure encoded as
 * plain text with leading-space indentation, e.g.:
 *
 *   Expression ((Project names + Projection))
 *     Aggregating
 *       Expression (Before GROUP BY)
 *         ReadFromMergeTree (default.hits)
 *
 * Each increase in leading-space width is a deeper level. This converts the
 * flat list of lines into a tree of {label, children} nodes by tracking
 * indentation depth on a stack. Lines that ClickHouse prefixes with structural
 * characters (e.g. PIPELINE's "(NodeName)") still nest purely by indentation,
 * so the same algorithm handles both modes.
