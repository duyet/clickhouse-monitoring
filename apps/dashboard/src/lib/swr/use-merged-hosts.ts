 *     is explorable without an account.
 *   - Signed-in user → the demo is HIDDEN ("empty it"); they see only their own
 *     browser/database connections. Zero connections drives the welcome/setup

 *

 * always shown, full access.

 * ```typescript
 * const { hosts, isLoading } = useMergedHosts()
 * ```
