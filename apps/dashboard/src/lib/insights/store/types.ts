/**
 * Pluggable persistence for AI Insights.
 *
 * AI Insights are persisted as *findings* — short, structured records of
 * something noteworthy on a cluster (see `lib/findings/findings-store.ts` for
 * the original ClickHouse-only implementation). This module abstracts that
 * persistence behind a small `InsightsStore` interface so the storage backend
 * can be selected at deploy time — exactly like the AI agent's pluggable
 * `ConversationStore` (`lib/conversation-store/`).
 *
 * Why this exists: the original engine wrote insights straight to a ClickHouse
 * table on the monitored cluster. On a read-only monitoring connection that
 * write silently fails, so insights never survive a reload. Letting operators
 * point persistence at D1 / Postgres / AgentState fixes that without giving the
 * monitoring user write access to the cluster it watches.
 *
 * Every method is **best-effort**: a backend that cannot write (read-only
 * cluster, missing binding) logs and returns `false`/`[]` rather than throwing,
 * so both the manual "Generate" endpoint and the cron sweep stay resilient.
 *
 * The interface intentionally reuses the `Finding` / `FindingRow` /
 * `ListFindingsOptions` shapes from the findings store so the read path
 * (`read-insights.ts` → `toCard`) is identical regardless of backend.
