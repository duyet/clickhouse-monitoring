/**
 * Alert de-duplication state store.
 *
 * The autonomous health sweep (`server-sweep.ts`) runs every few minutes over
 * every host. Without memory, a persistent unhealthy condition would webhook on
 * *every* run — pure noise. This module remembers the last severity we alerted
 * on per condition so the sweep only notifies when something is genuinely new:
 *
 *   - NEW        — a condition transitions ok → warning/critical
 *   - ESCALATED  — a condition worsens warning → critical
 *   - REMINDER   — a condition persists at the same severity past the cooldown
 *   - RECOVERY   — a previously-firing condition returns to ok
 *
 * Anything else (same severity within the cooldown window, or ok → ok) is
 * suppressed.
 *
 * Storage: an in-memory module singleton, mirroring the "memory fallback"
 * pattern the insights subsystem uses (`insights/store/memory-store.ts`) and the
 * table-existence cache. Alert dedup state is intentionally ephemeral — after a
 * cold start the worst case is a single duplicate alert per active condition,
 * which is acceptable. The pure {@link decideNotification} transition function
 * is decoupled from the backend so it is fully unit-testable.
 *
 * The logical condition key is `host:ruleId`; the last-fired severity lives in
 * the stored record (so the identity a record represents is
 * `host:ruleId:severity`, per the alerting spec). Keeping severity in the record
 * rather than the key is what lets us detect escalation and recovery, which both
 * need to compare the new severity against the previously-fired one.
