/**
 * Notification adapter layer — normalized alert payload + adapter contract.
 *
 * These types describe a channel-agnostic view of a health/alert event. Each
 * concrete adapter (Telegram, Slack, Discord, PagerDuty, generic JSON) turns an
 * {@link AlertPayload} into the request body that channel expects.
 *
 * Everything in this layer is PURE — no network, no side effects — so the
 * formatters are trivially unit-testable and safe to run anywhere. Wiring these
 * bodies to an actual transport (fetch, tokens, URLs) is the job of a later
 * dispatch slice, not this module.
 *
 * The severity vocabulary mirrors the health subsystem (`'warning' | 'critical'`
 * from `HealthAlertEvent` / `SweepFinding`) and adds `'recovery'` so an adapter
 * can render a resolved incident (🟢) — the "ok" transition the sweep detects.
