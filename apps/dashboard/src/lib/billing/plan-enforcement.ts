/**
 * Plan-benefit enforcement registry — the single source of truth for *whether
 * each advertised plan benefit is actually enforced in code yet*.
 *
 * Why this exists: `@chm/pricing` advertises limits + capabilities. This registry
 * is the single source of truth for *whether each advertised benefit is actually
 * gated in code*, so the gap between "advertised" and "enforced" can never drift
 * silently (the tests in `plan-enforcement.test.ts` fail if a benefit is added
 * without a classification, or if an `enforced` claim names no gate).
 *
 * Per-tier enforcement is now LIVE for the cost/abuse-bounded benefits: host cap,
 * AI daily-message cap, org seat cap, retention pruning, and the MCP capability.
 * All gates are **fail-open for self-hosted/OSS** — owner/plan resolution throws
 * without Clerk, and every call site swallows that to leave OSS ungated (the
 * "self-hosted stays whole" invariant). Benefits still marked `deferred` either
 * lack a feature to gate (alerting) or are intentionally free during beta.
 *
 * See plans/02-plan-benefits-parity.md.
