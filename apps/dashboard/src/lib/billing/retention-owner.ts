/**
 * Session-less billing-owner → retention-plan resolution for background jobs.
 *
 * `resolveBillingOwner()` (billing-owner.ts) reads the *current request session*
 * (the active Clerk org from the session JWT) and only works inside a signed-in
 * request. The retention-prune cron has no session — it iterates over raw
 * conversation `user_id`s — so it cannot use that path. Resolving the plan by the
 * bare `user_id` is WRONG for org-owned paid subscribers: paid plans are stored
 * under the Clerk **org** id (see user-subscription.ts / subscription-store.ts),
 * so a bare-user lookup misses the org subscription and resolves to free (7 days),
 * permanently deleting conversations the UI still shows on 30/90-day plans.
 *
 * This module resolves, without a session, the *effective* retention plan for a
 * given user by considering the billing owners the user could be enforced under:
 * their own user id PLUS every Clerk org they belong to. It returns the MOST
 * GENEROUS plan (longest retention; unlimited wins) among those owners, so the
 * cron never deletes history the read-filter in conversations.ts would still
 * display under the user's active org.
 *
 * Fail-safe: if the Clerk org enumeration fails, this THROWS rather than falling
 * back to the bare-user (free) plan — the cron's per-user try/catch then skips
 * pruning that user, so a transient Clerk hiccup can never cause silent deletion.
