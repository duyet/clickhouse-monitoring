//
// Conditionally mounts Clerk's <ClerkProvider> ONLY when isClerkClientEnabled() is
// true. When disabled, children render untouched and <ClerkProvider> is never
// instantiated - so non-Clerk builds never reach into Clerk's runtime, and any
// Clerk hook (useUser/useClerk), which MUST be gated behind the same
// isClerkClientEnabled() flag at its call site, is never invoked outside a provider.
//
// isClerkClientEnabled() is a build-time constant (both inputs are import.meta.env),
// so a non-Clerk build tree-shakes this down to `return children`.
//
// NOTE: this is the ONLY place that should import @clerk/tanstack-react-start
// unconditionally. Every other Clerk hook/component import must sit behind a
// lazy require/dynamic import guarded by isClerkClientEnabled() (mirroring the Next
// app's nav-user.tsx / agent-thread-page.tsx pattern).
