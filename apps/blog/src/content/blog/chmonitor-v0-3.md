chmonitor **v0.3** is the biggest release since the project started — a ground-up
rebuild on **TanStack Start**. Everything is new: a faster dashboard, an AI agent
that answers questions about your cluster, live query monitoring, a data
explorer, cluster topology, AI insights, and self-hosting that's a single command
on Cloudflare Workers, Docker or Kubernetes.

Here's the ~28-second launch film — every scene is the real product:

v0.3 lands 8 new features, more than 70 fixes, 13 performance wins, and 71 charts.

## Highlights

### A faster dashboard

The whole app moved to **TanStack Start** with a native Cloudflare Workers
bundle. Pages are prerendered as a static shell and hydrate with TanStack Query,
so the first paint is instant and data streams in progressively. Multi-host
routing stays as simple as `?host=0`.

### An AI agent that knows your cluster

The new agent connects over an **MCP server** and can read every system table.
Ask *"why is this query slow?"* or *"what changed in the last hour?"* and it
pulls the metrics, runs the diagnostic SQL, and explains what it found — no more
memorising table names.

### Health, audit and insights

Color-coded cluster **health** rolls up into a ready-made **audit prompt**, while
**AI Insights** continuously scans for anomalies and regressions and ranks them by
severity, so the important things float to the top.

### Self-host anywhere

A v0.3 deploy is one command. Run it on **Cloudflare Workers**, **Docker** or
**Kubernetes** — same codebase, same image, configured entirely through
environment variables.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Breaking changes

v0.3 is a rebuild, so a few things moved:

- **URL structure** changed from `/0/overview` to `/overview?host=0` (static
  routing + edge caching).
- **`fetchData()`** now requires a `hostId` parameter — it used to be optional.
- All data fetching moved **client-side**; there's no SSR data layer anymore.

Since the project has no backwards-compatibility guarantees yet, there's nothing
to migrate other than bookmarks.
